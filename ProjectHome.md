# Goal #

The goal of this project is to make an open source SIP user agent app for iPhone on firmware 2.x that will be released under an open source license.

# News #

Anyone who would like to submit code under the GPLv2 license to this project should email scott.williamson@gmail.com to sign up for source access. I have been extremly lazy and am hopeful that some of the interested people would like to share code to help the others who would like to see a SIP UA on the iPhone.
